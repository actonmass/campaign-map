# actonmass-campaign-map

Map of commitments to the [Act On Mass Transparency Campaign](https://actonmass.org/the-campaign/).

Built with [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), using data from a Google Sheet provided by the campaign, combined with geographic data from [bhrutledge/ma-legislature](https://github.com/bhrutledge/ma-legislature). Hosted on GitHub Pages.

I hope that this can serve as an example for similar maps, and maybe evolve into a template.

## Developing

Install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```sh
npm start
```

View the map at <http://localhost:3000>, or <http://localhost:3000/embed/> for an `iframe`-d version.

Publish changes by pushing them to the `main` branch.
